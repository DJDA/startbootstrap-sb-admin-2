          Dante
			is striving to reach the heights when he encounters the beasts. 
			Of the three, the lion with “his head held high” [con
			la test’ alta: 47] is the beast most closely associated with
			Pride.  Is the lion, as a negative exemplar of humility, a
			dream-like projection of Dante’s own besetting sin?  Virgil
			compels Dante to consider another symbol of Pride in his allusion
			to the burning of “proud Ilium” [superbo Ilïón:
			75].  This fallen site is heroically linked and morally contrasted
			to that “low-lying Italy” [quella
          <b>
           umile
          </b>
          Italia: 106] which the Veltro will eventually save despite its
			violent history.  Here the literal meaning of the Italian
			adjective “umile” is close to the etymological meaning
			of its Latin ancestor “humilis, ” i.e. “on the
			ground,” hence “lowly.”
         </p>

          That
			humility will be a major moral theme throughout
          <i>
           Purgatorio
          </i>
          – and not just in its First Cornice where the Angel of
			Humility will erase the first P (for the
          <i>
           peccatum
          </i>
          of Pride) from Dante’s forehead – is emblematically
			revealed in the moral prominence of the reed, “the humble
			plant” [l’
          <b>
           umile
          </b>
          pianta: 13
          5
          ]
			that miraculously springs up in the soft mud of the Island “at
			its lowest point” [ad imo ad imo: 100].  As a proud soul,
			Dante must lower himself to the ground – literally enact
			“humility” in response to Virgil’s command that
			he kneel in reverence to Cato – if he is ever to be saved
			himself or morally positioned to save Italy through his poem. He
			remains on his knee for twenty tercets [4
          9
          -108]
			until Cato vanishes from the scene.

          The
			leopard, “that beast with gaudy fur” [quella fiera a
			la gaetta pelle: 42], will be recollected by Dante on the brink of
			Malebolge when Virgil commands him to undo the cord from around
			his waist and hurl it into the abyss as a lure for another gaudy
			beast, Geryon.  “I had a cord around my waist, and with it I
			once thought to take the leopard with the painted pelt” [Io
			avea una corda intorno cinta / e con essa pensai alcuna volta /
			prender la lonza a la pelle dipinta:
          <i>
           Inf
          </i>
          .
			16.106-108], Dante recalls, filling in a detail not mentioned in
          <i>
           Inferno
          </i>
          1.

          Having
			remained ungirt since the Geryon episode, Dante will be regirt
			with a reed on the shore of Purgatory in fulfilment of Cato’s
			command to Virgil: “make sure you gird him with a straight
			reed” [fa che tu costui ricinghe / d’un giunco
			schietto: 94-95].  The straight reed contrasts with the pilgrim’s
			original cord, which was fittingly “coiled and knotted”
			[aggroppata e ravvolta:
          <i>
           Inf
          </i>
          .
			16.111] as a lure for the Beast of Fraud.
